# 17hats frontend challenges

As an all-in-one business solution, the 17hats app has an ever-expanding user interface.
To build and maintain this, we need people skilled in css, html, and javascript.
This repository contains a number of challenges testing your proficiency in these areas.
They are based on actual features, improvements and bugfixes.

## Challenge 1

17hats members don't just need tools to run their business, they also need reports to
see how their business is performing. Important metrics such as number of new leads;
client conversion rate; revenue per client, and cashflow allow them to improve vital
areas of their business.

In this challenge, you will create a cohort report containing some of these metrics.
